<h1>Chapter Three – Gearing Up</h1>
<h2>Gear is a Character</h2>
<p>Every piece of gear in Ghosting the Edge is treated as a character with its own aspects, skills, and stunts but, don’t panic, most of the time all those extra details are just background. {can we explain what that means and how it might actually work? The rest of the section explains the way that gear is different from a character. The exceptions.</p>
<p>In general, I like approaching things from a more, you instead of him or her. You, or your characters. This works for gms too because they are a you and they have their own characters. Though, as gm you tend to have characters. I suppose we could address ourselves to the players in general as a you. Ya’ll. }</p>
<h3>Gear is your Tool</h3>
<p>Unlike a character, your gear won’t operate independently, unless it has the <strong>Sapience</strong> stunt. Most of the time it will simply be part of your characters’ action either providing justification for it, like having a gun for Shooting, or providing access to its aspects, skills, and stunts.</p>
<h3>Unrated Skills</h3>
<p>Devices, even <strong>Sapient</strong> ones, don’t have a store of general knowledge or problem solving abilities like humans do so they can’t use skills they don’t have a rating for.</p>
<p>For example, A <strong>Sapient</strong> vehicle without a rating in the Shoot skill is not programmed to handle onboard weaponry and cannot take any actions involving them.</p>
<h3>Gear Aspects</h3>
<p>{don’t like this section. I want to make it a different thing. We want to say why gear aspects are different from most character aspects so we can say that for the most part we treat them like tags, or game details, but we can’t assume tht people actually know what that means. We want to tell people what a game detail is and how that is different from an aspect. What we are doing is pre-addressing concerns that people might have around so many aspects, which is a thing that we may not really want to be doing. We don’t need to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>But it is important to describe that we treat these aspects like game details and what game detail means. Ie, it’s narrative.</p>
<p>Also, we need to talk about some aspects which also have mechanical effects. Which is currently the last sentence of the section.}</p>
<p>Every piece of gear your character has can have several aspects of its own, but don’t panic! If you are concerned about keeping track of them all, gear aspects can be treated like game details most of the time.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few gear aspects that come with extra rules, but nothing more complicated than a stunt.</p>
<h3>Cost Rating</h3>
<p>Gear has an abstract cost rating that’s is roughly equivalent to its total refresh value.</p>
<p>The cost rating appears inside brackets (<span class='special-term-1'></span>) in an item’s stat block.</p>
<p>Starting characters pay this cost from their initial gear budget for the item.</p>
<p>In play, the cost is the base difficulty for acquiring that item.</p>
<h3>Starting Gear</h3>
<p>Starting characters typically get 2x their Resources rating for initial gear.</p>
<p>Some items have a <span class='special-term-1'>0</span> cost which means they may be had for free.</p>
<h2>Gear Catalog</h2>
<p>“You want to make it, sure you do. So does every meatsack in the Dis and we both know surviving here takes a gritty mash of guts and gear. If you’ve got the guts, then I’ve got the gear for you boy’o. I’ve got a Maglin Enforcer smart-linked combat shotgun, SlashRazor Hot Nerve Wires, and Titania Lux Spacedrop rated Assault Armor. You bet I do.” – Can-a-Bass. Dis Fixer</p>
<h3>Upgrades</h3>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>present some basics, what is an upgrade what is not an upgrade. Game-wise how they are handled. Important to note to people that you don’t have to use stunts or refresh to buy upgrades.</span></p>
<h4>Surgery, Recovery and Adjustment</h4>
<p>Upgrades are different from other pieces of gear. You can’t just buy one and drive it off the showroom floor. Even simple upgrades require an operation to implant them and connect them to your bodily systems, followed by an extended process of recovery, therapy, and training to make use of your new device.</p>
<p>Characters are assumed to have gone through this for their initial upgrades, but when they buy a new one during play they’ll need to go through the recovery and adjustment process. Luckily, the more you pay the faster you can make it.</p>
<p>The default Consequence for an upgrade is Moderate. This Consequence is for medical recovery and for the time needed to adjust to using the gear. Learning to mentally activate an interface, or get used to the enhanced reaction times of Boosted Reflexes.</p>
<p>By adding 1 to the cost of the item, the severity of the recovery and adjustment consequence can be reduced by 1. By adding 2 to the cost the Severity can be reduced by 2.</p>
<p>Some upgrades are more <em><strong>invasive</strong></em> or <em><strong>difficult to adjust to</strong></em> and for these the character’s Consequence is increased by one severity. Making Mild the least possible.</p>
<p>Other upgrades are non-invasive or easy to adjust to and these reduce the severity of the complication by one.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>this is an example of typing to see if things are still slow. So slow. So, what if we close the browser? Not much better. That makes me sad. I need a good snappy writing experience. Disabled a bunch of intel stupid stuff and it’s now way better. Thank goodness. Hate you intel. Soo much and your fucking key tracking mess. So appropriate to this genre too. </span></p>
<h4>Neural Implants</h4>
<p>Neural implants are a hot mess of processors and nanofibers wired into every damned part of your brain and nervous system; they let you hack the basic functions of your brain.</p>
<h5>Interfaces</h5>
<p>The interface implant allows a direct connection between a device and your brain. It’s what enables augmented and virtual realities to feed directly into your senses, and allows you to control devices with your thoughts.</p>
<p>A modern interface is a complex array of nanofibers implanted throughout your brain and merging into a hardware jack implanted at the back of your neck, behind your ear, or on your temple.</p>
<p>In many ways interface technology is the basis of our modern society. It’s mind-machine connection defines how to we interact with technology, information, and even each other.</p>
<p>It defines our era in another way as well. Everything you do with your interface is tagged with an id that uniquely identifies your interface, and by definition, you.</p>
<h6>Unlocked Interfaces</h6>
<p>Most characters will have a “rooted interface” which has the usual corporate controls and safeguards removed. Giving the character complete control over their device and allowing them to do things like fiddle with the interface id to conceal their true identities.</p>
<h6>Wirelessly interface with the Net and local nets</h6>
<h6>Allows you to Interface with smart devices</h6>
<h6>Access Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h6>
<p>Can act as a personal digital assistant, taking calls and messages, tracking your calendar and reminding you of events, and providing instant access to most of your life. Banking, medical records and such.</p>
<h6>Brain dive with other Interfaced characters</h6>
<p>The interface implant is what allows you to plug your mind into machines and the Net. Physically, it’s billions of nanowires connected to most every part of your brain. It’s not as invasive as it sounds, the wires and the neuron surgery are done by an injection of nanomachines, though people often experience some rather interesting mental and sensory feedback during interface construction. The wires all gather at central socket that’s commonly at the temple or the back of the neck and your actual interface hardware plugs into that socket. Once your brain is wired for an interface you can usually upgrade by just replacing your interface device.</p>
<p>If you are a too out of date with your interface wiring however, you might have to get additional parts of your brain wired into your interface socket.</p>
<h6>Direct Contact Plate</h6>
<p>A common add-on for interfaces is the <em><strong>Direct Contact Plate</strong></em> placed somewhere on your body (Finger tips and the palms are common). The plate is directly wired to your interface allowing you connect to a smart device through the contact plate instead of plugging in an external wire or using a wireless connection.</p>
<h6>ThotCom Quality Interface <span class='special-term-1'>0</span></h6>
<p>The ThotCom is a fair example of an affordable commercial interface device.</p>
<p><em><strong>Neurological Implant, Weak Wireless Radio, Smart Device</strong></em></p>
<p>Barrier 2, Investigate 1, Know 1, Notice 0, Hardening 1, Move 0 <span class='special-term-1'>Net only}, Fight 0 {Net only</span></p>
<h6>G-Gob Hardened Interface <span class='special-term-1'>3</span></h6>
<p>A pretty standard interface for professional users. Most of the bells and whistles are more flash then substance, but the G-Gob is popular for its high quality defense barrier programming.</p>
<p><em><strong>Neurological Implant, Bells and Whistles, Smart Device</strong></em></p>
<p>Barrier 3, Hardening 2, Investigate 1, Know 1, Notice 2, Move 2 <span class='special-term-1'>Net only}, Fight 2 {Net only</span></p>
<h6>Ithcara Pearl Personal Interface <span class='special-term-1'>2</span></h6>
<p>The Ithcara Pearl is not just an interface, it’s a personal assistant experience. A favorite of corp execs. It features an autonomous computer intelligence which can perform a variety of tasks on command or as needed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interface Implant; Pearl, Your Personal Net Assistant; Smart Device</strong></em></p>
<p>Barrier 2, Investigate 2, Know 2, Hardening 1, Notice 1, Move 1 <span class='special-term-1'>Net only}, Fight 0 {Net only}, Stealth 0 {Net only</span></p>
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> – This interface has an independent persona named Pearl, by default, who acts as your personal assistant in the Net. It can perform research, send flowers, and even draft memos based upon your previous writing samples. Pearl can also manifest a distinct presence in the Net.</p>
<h5>Boosted Reflexes</h5>
<p>Boosted reflexes usually means implanting nanofiber links directly from brain to muscle fibers, bypassing the syrupy slow human nervous system. Implanted sensory processors allow the brain actually integrate visual data fast enough to make the increased reaction time useful. Without these processors, boosted reflexes feels like riding a hyperactive cyberhorse; with them you get the nearest thing to slowing down time we humans have yet achieved.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>see the fighting section later for info about relay initiative</span></p>
<p><strong>Boosted Reflexes <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2, 3</span></strong> – When activated you get the aspect <em><strong>Hotwired Reflexes</strong></em> for the remainder of the scene, and one free invoke per level of boosted reflexes. You can use your free invokes on applicable actions like fighting, and especially to seize the initiative from other characters.</p>
<h5>Sense Processors</h5>
<p>Commonly the counterpart to boosted reflexes, this type of upgrade can also be implanted separately to help you deal with fast moving and highly detailed situations. Sense processors do additional acquisition and filtering of sensory data which is then provided directly to your brain to help you make decisions. Runners describe the info from these processors as being like a little voice in the back of your head compelling you to notice something you would have missed on your own, like that BikePunk sneaking up on you.</p>
<p><strong>Compensators <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – +2 to D against sensory overload based attacks. Flashbang grenades, sonic noise attack, and such.</p>
<p>**Hostile Target Alert System <span class='special-term-1'>1}** – This sense processor helps you determine friend from foe in a fast moving situation. {What’s a good effect for this? Does it track active hostiles or does it detect hostiles before they get the drop on you? </span></p>
<h5>Skillwire</h5>
<p>A natural extension of sense processor and interface technologies is the skillwire implant which allows you to instantly plug new skills directly into your brain. They can be information sets like: languages, maps, or the personnel profiles of an entire company. They can be semi-active skills like piloting a specific type of vehicle, or even very active skills, like Kung Fu.</p>
<p>Some people find the nearly subconscious nudging of these kind of processors unsettling, especially ones that key into your motor activation centers because you can find your body doing things before your conscious mind catches up; assuming you disable the safety protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Skillwire Slot <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2, 3</span></strong> – For each Skillwire slot you can choose one program. You may change the program in a slot at any time, but it takes one scene for the new skill to become available to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Language</strong> – You can read and speak a specific language. Most tend towards the formal and correct and so are obviously programs; unless you are willing to pay extra for an up to date colloquialized version.</p>
<p><strong>Specialty</strong> – These programs have everything you need to know about a specific topic such herbs, or military history. +2 to O and C actions involving that specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot</strong> – Contains the skills for pilot a specific type of vehicle. +2 to O for this specific model.</p>
<p><strong>Kung Fu</strong> – An encyclopedic knowledge of Kung Fu moves looks very cool but unless you have a cyborg body or have already built up the appropriate musculature to back up the physical skills it’s not as useful as most teenage chipbois dream it is. <strong>Without cyberbody</strong> +2 for O relating to Kung Fu. <strong>With cyberbody</strong> Kung Fu style Fight skill set to 2. If you already have a fight skill,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Alternate Skillwire <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – You may swap the ratings of two pluggable skills between scenes. This may require a Resources roll to acquire a new skill program, and if there is no time really downtime between scenes you may have to use your original values for a while. Or, more interestingly, you might gain the trouble aspect <em><strong>Skills A and B are Swapping.</strong></em></p>
<p>Most skills can be swapped except: Contact, Move, Physique, Resources, and Will.</p>
<h4>Limbs</h4>
<p>A cyberpunk classic. I’m not going to bother tell you how one works or give you a lecture about the physics of lifting things with only one cyberlimb. Most cyberlimbs are just replacements for parts lost to disease or misfortune and are no better or worse than a meat appendage. Typical cyberlimbs require no stunt slots but you should strongly consider working them into a character aspect where they can be of some use to you. And maybe get hacked or knocked out by EMP. Occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Cyberlimb <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – +2 for actions involving the limb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hand or Arms</strong> – Crushing and some lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Legs</strong> – Running and jumping.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Eyes &amp; Ears</h4>
<p>Cybereyes and ears were a lot more popular before we cracked the brain’s sense processing pathways. Used to be, replacing your eyes and ears was the only way to get high resolution VR and AR input. Now, we can just beam it all directly into your brain. Still, cybernetic sense organs can do all sorts of flexible and useful things.</p>
<p>You can take</p>
<p>Cybereyes and ears are fairly similar mechanically, the initial upgrade gives you a bonus to notice and one extra capability. An additional stunt gives you two extra capabilities. You can treat these capabilities as aspects if you find that appropriate or they can just be game details.</p>
<p><strong>Cybereyes <span class='special-term-1'>1}** – +1 to Notice for sight based O and one extra capability. **Cybereyes {2</span> –</strong> Add two extra capabilities. For a total of 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recorder</strong> – Anything you see is recorded as video. You can mentally control playback and brain dive the video if you have an Interface.</p>
<p><strong>Thermographic</strong> – You can see heat, which makes most ordinary attempts to hide from you futile.</p>
<p><strong>Nightvision</strong> – These cybereyes amplify existing light. You can see normally even in very low light, but not complete darkness. You may also experience overload when the compensators are unable to deal with a sudden bright light.</p>
<p><strong>Telescopic</strong> – Take a much closer look at something interesting. Trade your peripheral vision for it though so be careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cyberears <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – +1 to Notice for hearing based O and one extra capability.</p>
<p><strong>Cyberears <span class='special-term-1'>2</span></strong> – Add two extra capabilities. For a total of 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recorder</strong> – Record what you hear.</p>
<p><strong>Encrypted Radio</strong> – On occasion it’s useful to have a communication channel that doesn’t route through the Net, or your wireless interface. Not everyone thinks to bring equipment to eavesdrop on old fashioned radio signals.</p>
<p><strong>Amplification and Isolation</strong> – You can focus in on a particular sound source. Like maybe a conversation? Doing so will filter out all the sounds, except what you focus on.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Physical Enhancements</h4>
<p>Any number of other physical upgrades are possible from vat muscles, to extra hearts and livers, to extendable rollerblades in your feet.</p>
<p><strong>Skin and Bone Lacing <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – Inside and out you are reinforced. Your skin is harder to pierce, your bones harder to break. Add an extra physical stress box.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Grafts <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – Why go to the gym when you can get vat grown bio enhanced muscle implants? Packs a punch and looks great under a tee-shirt. +2 for lifting, jumping, and any sheer muscle based actions.</p>
<h4>Defenses</h4>
<p>Defensive upgrades also come in many kinds: sub dermal plates affixes to a character’s skeleton, heavy duty cyborg bodies build for combat, thermal insulation layers, or even anti-missile interference generators. They can usually be bought more the once and stacked.</p>
<h5>Dermal Plating</h5>
<p>Armor plates embedded over or under your skin. Either way they are not very subtle and project your profession to whoever sees or scans you.</p>
<p><strong>Dermal Plating <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – You get a <em><strong>Ballistic Armor</strong></em> aspect and you may choose to roll Physique to D against ballistic attacks.</p>
<p>**Dermal Plating <span class='special-term-1'>2}** – As Dermal Plating {1</span> and you get a +2 to D against ballistic attacks.</p>
<p>**Dermal Plating <span class='special-term-1'>3}** – As Dermal Plating {1</span> and you get a +4 to D against ballistic attacks.</p>
<h5>Thermal Insulation</h5>
<p>This might layers of heat dispersing material in a cyborg body, or advanced skin weaving</p>
<p>**Thermal Insulation <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against heat and fire and heat based effects.</p>
<h5>Induction Shielding</h5>
<p>These might be implanted dispersion nets, or simply hardened circuitry.</p>
<p>**Induction Shielding <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against electrical and EMP effects.</p>
<h5>Sensor Defense</h5>
<p>These defenses create interference that makes it more difficult for electronic sensors to detect the character. It might be an active “noise” generating device, or it might be a cleverly engineered skin coating that baffles sensors.</p>
<p>**Sensor Defense <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against electronic sensor detection and guided weapons.</p>
<h4>Implanted Weapons</h4>
<p>There’s a truly startling number of implanted weapon scenarios. Poison gas false teeth, toe-grenades, razor sharp finger-scalpels, the tried and true cyberarm missile launcher for messy assassinations, or a simple bomb at the base of your brain for instant self-destruct.</p>
<p><strong>Finger Razors <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – Small scalpel blades implanted beneath your fingernails remain hidden until you extend them with a thought. There are not terribly dangerous on their own, but they can surprise the unwary and be handy for incapacitating wrists, or blinding a target. +2 to C with Fight when you can apply your razors.</p>
<p><strong>Concealed Weapon <span class='special-term-1'>1</span></strong> – You have a generic smart weapon concealed in a cyberlimb, forearms are a common choice, which you can reveal and fire with simply a thought. Your weapon gets +2 to resist being detected.</p>
<h4>To Be Categorized</h4>
<p>Pheromone Generators</p>
<p>Vampire Fhangs</p>
<h3>Cybernetic Prosthesis Body</h3>
<p>The ultimate in upgrade, the cusp of transhumanity, cyborg bodies are completely artificial mechanical and electronic bodies your interface enabled brain can be implanted in. Some people claim all you really need to do is copy your memories into an electronic brain and that will be the real you. But, only the most extreme cybercultists are willing to abandon their meat. For most people, meat still equals identity.</p>
<p>Cyber bodies come with a host of benefits. You don’t age, you don’t get sick, you don’t bleed and you don’t have to breathe, you don’t ever have to diet, and you can look any way you want to.</p>
<p>Cyber bodies take some adjustment though. At first it can feel like one of those dreams where you can’t get your body to do the things you tell it to. Even the most skilled cyber body operator is still an operation. It’s like riding a bike, you might never forget once you’ve mastered the modified proprioception of a cyber prosthetic body.</p>
<p>Cyber bodies are often rated according to their speed and durability. Essentially, their Move and Physique ratings. 1 is good, 2 is the usual minimum rating for dangerous occupations like construction or rescue. 3 and above are usually referred to as combat rated, or sometimes, high spec.</p>
<p>Cyberbodies are metal and plastic and hydraulics and, on average, they weight around twice as much as a human body of the same size. This has benefits and drawbacks. It makes a cyborg a lot harder to wrestle or push around, but it can also be a limitation if you have a lot of heavy combat cyborgs somewhere that was built with humans in mind. Like an old elevator.</p>
<p>Cyberbodies don’t get tired either. You can hold something up, like hold a girder in place and lock your servos so it won’t move and you’ll never get tired of holding it him. Speaking of girders, cyberbodies are also really strong, or they can be for a really skilled operator. Their mechanical systems can generate magnitudes more force then human muscles can, which makes a combat cyborg with a melee weapon a seriously dangerous proposition, even for someone in armor.</p>
<p>You can also hack your own body. One hack is so ubiquitous that every ganger has a mod for it is turning off pain sensors. This is one reason that cyborgs can roll Physique to resist any attacks.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s an urban legend that’s been attributed to various street samurai over the years, but the gist of it goes, this cyborg samurai gets his eyes and ears destroyed by an improvised explosive when he’s fighting these gangers. They figure he’ll be easy to wear down now that he’s blinded, but he’s hacks his cyborg body by rerouting the touch perception of his skin to his eyes and boosting the touch sensitivity so high that he could “see and hear” where the gangers were coming from as they shouted at him and compressed the air that touched his super sensitive skin. And he didn’t have to feel the pain where they hit him.</p>
<h4>Cyber Prosthetics</h4>
<p>Pick some body parts, up to and including all of them, and we can give you mechanical versions guaranteed to meet AND beat the specifications of the original.</p>
<p>Cyber prosthetics don’t automatically require a stunt slot. You can have any bit of yourself replaced for fun, fashion, or medical reasons with a prosthesis that more or less mimics your missing pieces.</p>
<p>You don’t have to, but it’s a lot more fun if you work cyber prosthetics into a character’s aspects where it can be invoked and compelled.</p>
<h4>Cyberbody</h4>
<p>The cyber brain makes it possible to place your mind inside a completely fabricated cybernetic prosthesis body. It takes some practice, but you can learn to control it as if it were a natural one.</p>
<p>Standard cybernetic bodies are, in the main, no better or worse than a natural one. You may not be susceptible to human diseases and you can run and jump without becoming tired, but your cyberbody will require constant, and very expensive, maintenance and updates.</p>
<p>A cyberbody doesn’t require any stunt slots, but does require an aspect indicating the character is a cyborg. This aspect can be invoked when performing many physical feats and compelled when appropriate. A cyberbody, by itself, doesn’t provide any additional bonuses, and it does not have to be a human shaped body.</p>
<h4>Basic Cybernetic Body</h4>
<p>You can have a basic cybernetic body simply by writing it into one of your aspects. Examples: <em><strong>Medical Prosthetic Body, Crazed Combat Cyborg, Prototype Aria Cyberbody, or Heavy Construction Cyborg, Deep Water Spider Body, Gev-Tallen Designer Cyberbody</strong></em></p>
<p>A basic cyberbody will look and operate more or less like a normal human one. Some bodies are human looking but fall into the Uncanny Valley and give most people the creeps, lots of designer bodies are flawlessly beautiful fantasies come true, but cyberbodies can be designed for all manner of purposes. Some are humanoid but gigantic, metallic and ugly, designed with practicality for heavy dangerous construction work, or they can be completely inhuman robot bodies, like the many legged spider bodies that are used for construction and repair in space and underwater.</p>
<p>Ideally, your basic cyberbody aspect should imply the nature of its benefits and limitations because it’s the aspect that you invoke when you use your cybernetic body to your advantage and it’s the aspect that will get compelled when your body works to your disadvantage.</p>
<p>These advantages apply to all cyberbodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your body does not age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not get sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your muscles do not get tired, your brain can still suffer from fatigue and lose the ability to focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do still have to eat, a sugar and protein mix to supply your brain meat with what it needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do still need to sleep to allow your brain to store long term memories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You still dream. Operators adapting to their first cyberbody often dream about losing control of their new device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These advantages apply to most cyberbodies, but may not depending on its exact construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can be more perfect looking then any human, or look not at all like a human</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can be stronger than any human body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might run faster and farther than human body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may be able to jump farther than any human and drop from greater heights without danger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You movements can be far more delicate and precise, you don’t suffer the same constant adjustments and slight tremors that human bodies do. You can, in fact, move your body to a position and then have it freeze in place while you prepare your mind for the next precise movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may weigh more, sometimes a lot more, then an equivalently sized meat body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All your senses can work as normal or better. They may be far more sensitive than a normal human’s and you may have senses no human has, such as infravision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cyberbody Upgrades</h4>
<p>There’s a number of upgrades that are common amongst cyberbodies.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Cyborg</strong> – You have advanced filters against pain sensations and a body constructed for combat. Roll Physique to D against any attack.</p>
<p><strong>Ballistic Armor</strong> – You have obvious or concealed armor against small arms attacks. +2 to D against Ballistic attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Construction</strong> – You’re cyberbody is designed to resist more damage than most and remain fully operational. +1 Stress Box.</p>
<p><strong>Concealed Weapon</strong> – You have a generic smart weapon concealed in your cyberbody, forearms are a common choice, which you can reveal and fire with simply a thought. Your weapon gets +2 to resist being detected.</p>
<h3>Armaments</h3>
<p>You might think that close quarters fighting is a thing of the past and that a knife or even a club improvised from the railing Martin the crazy combat cyborg just crushed with your feeble meat body, is no kind of weapon for a street samurai like you to be using. But let me say, with the strength that a cyborg body can grant someone, and the advances in defensive materials, a good strong knife is a good a weapon on the street as it ever has been.</p>
<h4>Ammo</h4>
<p>Ammunition is a special concern for many weapons. Not so much for fear of running out, it would be a long firefight where you had to worry about running out of ammo, but because you will have to reload at some point and that will be a moment of weakness.</p>
<p>Many small arms have an abstract measure of how many times you use them before reloading called an Ammo Track. It’s usually between 2 and 5, but it can be more.</p>
<p>Ammo is not an exact record of shots, it’s an abstract measure of your weapon’s capacity and how efficient you are at using it. Some attacks you make with a gun might take you three or four shots to get your target, other attacks might only take one. Some weapons, like the Colt Striking Hawk are designed to be highly accurate and with advanced firing support programs that help you make every shot count.</p>
<p>Light weapons like two person machine guns, and vehicle, drone, or robot mounted weapons don’t always have an ammo track because they have extensive reserves of ammo.</p>
<p>We assume that it takes most people more than one round to achieve the aim of their action.</p>
<p>Whenever you use your weapon in an action you mark ammo whether your action succeeds or not. If you succeed with style you can choose trade the normal benefit for not marking ammo instead. Skilled shooters can get the job done with fewer rounds, and sometimes, really skilled shooters can get it done with just the intimidation value of their empty weapon.</p>
<p>If your opponent succeeds with style on a defend action against you, then can choose to trade their normal benefit to make you mark ammo.</p>
<p>When you run out of ammo you can ditch that weapon or reload. Ditching your empty weapon and picking up another doesn’t require an action unless there’s some circumstance that could oppose you. Like you are <em><strong>pinned down by fire</strong></em>. In which case it will require an O with Shoot.</p>
<p>Reloading a weapon in a firefight does require an O action with Shoot. Free of any extenuating circumstances, reloading is a +0 difficulty.</p>
<p>Weapons that are <em><strong>Hard to Load</strong></em> are trickier, their default opposition is to reload is +2.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>If you succeed with style on a reloading action, you can trade your boost to do it in 0 time, that is an option, but it does kind of take away from the point of reloading</span></p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>Switching weapons, normally not an action, but underfire you might have to make an overcome. </span></p>
<p>If you fail your reload roll there are various options for succeeding at cost. Maybe you brought the wrong kind of ammo and take some kind of ongoing negative aspect. Maybe you jammed your weapon and will have to take it to the shop to clear it. Maybe you just mark off a couple of ammo boxes because one of your clips was underloaded, or you couldn’t get all the bullets back in your revolver.</p>
<h4>Close Combat Weapons</h4>
<p>Always fun. Knifes, swords, and more advanced weapons like tasers and stun batons.</p>
<h5>GENERIC BLADE <span class='special-term-1'>0</span></h5>
<p>A perfectly ordinary blade forged of magnetically aligned steel for added strength and penetration.</p>

<h4>Small Arms</h4>
<p>Small arms is a general term for ranged weapons a single person can carry and use. It includes firearms and energy weapons, and non-explosive based projectile weapons like electromagnetic rail guns.</p>
<p>Cyberization is having an impact on the size and type of weapons that can be effectively carried. Larger firearms with more ammunition can be carried by a single cyborg as can the batteries required to power battle ready energy weapons.</p>
<p>Small to medium caliber firearms still form the bulk of small arms manufactured today.</p>
<h5>Aspects and Stunts for Small Arms</h5>
<p>Here’s a number of aspects and stunts specifically for small arms. Some are relatively neutral tags, but some are distinct drawbacks and have mechanical effects in addition to the limitations they imply.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ballistic</strong></em> – A tag for weapons that launch relatively small and soft projectiles at a target. Including all firearms. Mainly used to identify attacks ballistic armor is designed to stop.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recoil</strong></em> – Most firearms designed for real combat reduce or eliminate recoil but some weapons are designed more to intimidate then to efficiently kill lots of people. Others are just cheap knockoffs or terrible designs.</p>
<p>Weapons with <em><strong>Recoil</strong></em> tend to make you lose your aim with every shot. Many aspects created with such a weapon are reduced to boosts. Aspects regarding careful aim are chief amongst the affected, but also, providing <em><strong>Covering Fire, Setting up a Killzone</strong></em>, <em><strong>and Pinning Them Down</strong></em> all turn into boosts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em> – Weapons with this aspect don’t just suffer from recoil, they suffer from lots of recoil. Every shot with a <em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em> weapon requires you to give an opponent a boost against you are <em><strong>Driven Back</strong></em>, you become <em><strong>Unbalanced</strong></em>, or your <em><strong>Arm Turns Numb</strong></em>. If you succeed with style on an A you can trade a normal boost from that for not giving a foe a recoil based boost.</p>
<p><em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em> counts as two negative aspects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em> can also apply to unenhanced humans using large weapons that are designed for cyborgs or vehicles.</p>
<p>You can roll an O action to counteract recoil aspects. Cyborgs with a high Physique may be able to brace themselves it and crafty characters could jury-rig a weapon harness or some recoil compensation. <em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em> counts as two aspects so requires an O of at least +4.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reduced Penetration</strong></em> – This aspect makes attacks less effective at penetrating armor and cover. Any bonuses from armor or cover related stunts or aspects get a +3 instead of a +2.</p>
<p>So, invoking a <em><strong>Cover</strong></em> aspect gives your target a +3 per invoke instead of a +2. A <strong>ballistic armor</strong> stunt would add +3 to defend instead of +2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hard to Load</strong></em> – Weapons that are <em><strong>Hard to Load</strong></em> increase the opposition to reload them by +2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Limited Range or Inaccurate At Range or Ineffective At Range</strong></em> –Defenders get a +1 to D for every zone they are distant from the attacker. This could be because the weapon is inaccurate or because it disperses quickly or loses its energy quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Capacity</strong> – +2 Ammo.</p>
<p>**Autofire <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – Mark an extra ammo and take a +1 or mark 2 extra ammo and affect a zone. You may only mark 2 extra ammo per action. {Mark up to 4 extra ammo for one action.</span></p>
<p><strong>High-powered</strong> – +2 to A targets in the same zone but your attacks have <em><strong>Reduced Penetration.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Hollowpoints</strong> – Cause really nasty wounds. If someone takes a consequence from your attack, increase its severity by one, however your attacks also have <em><strong>Reduced Penetration</strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Penetration –</strong> +2 to A targets defending with cover or armor.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> – +2 for O with Shoot where accuracy is important.</p>

<h3>Defenses</h3>
<p>The thing about armor is this; there is no universal defense. Armor is always a trade off, and different types are specialized for different situations. Even in the future, knowledge is your best weapon. If you know what kind of weapons and armor you opposition has, you’ll know what you should bring.</p>
<h4>Types of Armor</h4>
<h5>Personal</h5>
<p>Personal armor is a category of commercial protection. Things like bullet proof vests and dermal plating are the sorts of things that are considered personal armor. Personal armor is only basic protection. It can stop only the most common kinds of attacks most people encounter and it’s designed to maintain the mobility and function of the wearer. Personal armor sometimes includes a helmet, but very rarely does it protect every part of your body.</p>
<h5>Combat</h5>
<p>Combat armor is designed for the battlefield. It goes far beyond personal protection. Combat armor is almost always a complete suit, including a helmet, and protects against more kinds of dangers then personal armor does, including explosives or light machines guns.</p>
<p>Combat armor favors protection over mobility, but it also usually has advanced features to help overcome some of those design limitations, such as helmet interfaces and secure squad level communications.</p>
<h5>Assault</h5>
<p>Wearing assault armor is just shy of being a combat cyborg. Assault armor offers all the protection and features of combat armor along with strength boosting servos, and thrusters. Every suit is essentially a miniaturized jet fighter and costs even more.</p>
<h4>Armor Materials</h4>
<p>The material armor is made of makes a good deal of difference in how it performs and what its limitations are.</p>
<h5>Composite Plates</h5>
<p>Is the most common armor material. There’s a number of varieties but they all boil down to arranging some amount of nano-fiber in a larger matrix material to make a plate that can be used to cover vital areas. <em><strong>Composite</strong></em> is relatively cheap and easy to find, but weights more than more exotic nano materials It also lacks flexibility and so composite armor will inevitably have joints and seams.</p>
<p>Composite Plates offer good protection, but they will deform and break as they absorb attacks and lose their protective qualities.</p>
<p>Classic body armor is made of composite plates or scales sewn into a vest or implanted under your skin. All in all Composite offers good protection for moderate weight and cost.</p>
<h5>Flexible Nanoscale</h5>
<p>Layers of interlocking nanoscales that absorb impact by intermeshing. It provides uniform protection and is light and flexible. However, its structure is derived from a fish that evolved the design to defeat shark bites, so <em><strong>Flexible Nanoscale</strong></em> is more useful against the ripping and tearing from animal attacks or accidents then from penetration wounds of firearms.</p>
<h5>Reactive Nanocloth</h5>
<p>A thin sheet of nanolattice woven with carbon nano tubes creates a superlight strong and flexible material. It’s very expensive and not</p>
<h5>Nanofoam</h5>
<p>thin and light and flexible. Best against explosives, and blunt impact. Firearms, especially AP rounds can penetrate it.</p>
<h5>Magnetorheological Fluid</h5>
<p>Strong and flexible, not all that light, also requires continuous power to maintain its protection.</p>
<h4>Armor Aspects and Stunts</h4>
<p><em><strong>Degrades</strong></em> – Most armor materials start to fail after taking several hits. The more impact they absorb more their protective qualities degrade, which is a fact clever characters can exploit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deterioration</strong></em> – Most armor is susceptible to environment conditions. It may fail after being exposed to heat, cold, water, or other extremes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Partial Coverage</strong></em> – This aspect is for armor that doesn’t cover all part of the body such as a vest or a body suit which doesn’t include a helmet. It can also include armor lacking uniform protection, such as a body suit with weak joints and seams. In either case, armor with this aspect has weakness that your opponents can exploit. It also, usually means that the armor is not air tight and cannot protect you against airborne attacks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bulky</strong></em> – <em><strong>Bulky</strong></em> armor will affect your speed and mobility.</p>
<p>**Ballistic Protection <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against A from small and medium caliber firearms and shrapnel.</p>
<p>**Close Quarters Protection <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2} –** +2 {+4</span> to D against A from blades, clubs and other close quarters weapons.</p>
<p><strong><span class='special-term-1'>against blunt attacks and explosives. Like nano-foam</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class='special-term-1'>maybe even hardened armor that protects against penetrating attacks.</span></strong></p>
<p>**Combat Protection <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against A from explosives and medium to large caliber firearms.</p>
<p>**Thermal Insulation <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against heat and fire and heat effects.</p>
<p>**Induction Shielding <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against electrical and EMP effects.</p>
<p>**Sensor Protection <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2}** – +2 {+4</span> to D against electronic sensor detection and guided weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Expert</strong> – You an expert at using your defenses to absorb attacks. If you have armor or cover you may roll Physique to D against most attacks, including uncommon types such as explosions.</p>
<h4>Personal Armor</h4>
<p>Personal armor is designed to protect you against the most common threats: small and medium caliber firearms, shrapnel, blades and blunt weapons wielded by human foes. It does not provide total coverage, though it can be more or less concealed. It won’t protect you against large caliber weapons like a heavy machine gun, explosives, and energy weapons, high velocity projectiles like rail gun, gases, biologicals, or grappling range close combat weapons.</p>
<p>Personal armor is not a perfect defense, it’s a tradeoff between protection, mobility, weight, and the qualities of the particular defensive material used. Some armor materials are sensitive to heat and moisture, others degrade after being hit just a few times. All these translate into aspects that clever samurai can exploit and that GMs can use to challenge players.</p>
<p>Some character know how to use their armor to greater effect.</p>
<h5>Generic Ballistic Vest <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2</span></h5>
<p>A vest containing plates of composite armor material to protect your vital areas from common street level threats. They also have slots that allow you to add heavier plates for protection against higher caliber weapons.</p>

<h5>Mobeus Dragon Cloth™ <span class='special-term-1'>1, 2</span></h5>
<p>One of the top sellers for this boutique brand is their patented dragon cloth. Under normal conditions it’s a soft and pliable as ordinary cloth, but upon sudden impact the reactive nanofibers in the cloth hardens to absorb the attack. It works against nearly every kind of attack but it loses its protective qualities quickly when subject to too much force. However, what makes Dragon Cloth worth its exorbitant price is its self-repairing design. If allowed to rest, it’s protective qualities will return.</p>
<p>Elite corp mercs also like it for its resilience. You make quite an impression when you walk away from a grenade explosion with you clothes still in immaculate condition.</p>
<p>Typically entire suits of clothes are made of dragon cloth, which also gives it more coverage than most common personal armor.</p>

<h4>Drones</h4>
<h5>GEMic DS Butterfly Drone</h5>
<p>GEMic’s DS class butterfly drones are unassuming, fluttery, beautiful, and very very dangerous. They have powerful short range projectors that can read and induce current in devices. Meaning that if a DS lands on a device it can interface and interact with it even if that device’s wireless is turned off. The DS is not powerful enough to allow a hacker to interface through it, but can induce the device to turn itself on and switch to promiscuous mode.</p>
<h4>Robots</h4>

<h3>Vehicles</h3>
<h4>Vectordyne</h4>
<p>A newer class of aircraft, the vectordyne is essentially the long awaited flying car. It’s a car, or commonly, a van-sized vehicle with multiple turborotors to provide lift. A turborotor is something like a really big computer fan crossed with a jet engine. These rotors are directional to provide maneuvering power, hence the vector part of the name.</p>
<p>Vectordyne craft are more maneuverable then helicopters but are just as loud, if not louder. They can create more lift then a helicopter of similar size and their turborotors can be armored much more effectively then a helicopter’s rotor. Vectordyne craft have top speeds ranging from 100 mph to 450 mph.</p>

<h2>Gear Stating Guidelines</h2>
<p>If you need to quickly stat-up a piece of gear these guidelines will be super helpful.</p>
<p>Start with an Average <span class='special-term-1'>1</span> cost. Add upgrades, and subtract downgrades for the final cost rating.</p>
<h3>Average <span class='special-term-1'>1</span> Gear</h3>
<h4>Aspects</h4>
<p>Take one trouble aspect and other balanced aspects such as <em><strong>Smart Device</strong></em> as appropriate.</p>
<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>Take 0 to 5 points worth of skills with a cap of 2 for any single skill.</p>
<p>Some items are designed to do just one thing and have a specialized skill for that, like a grenade’s Explode skill. These specialized can exceed the skill cap by 2.</p>
<p>Most devices don’t have many skills; four or five is a lot, and seven is probably too many.</p>
<p>Write down rating 0 skills too because devices can’t roll if they don’t have a rating.</p>
<h4>Stunts</h4>
<p>Take an appropriate stunt.</p>
<h3>For <span class='special-term-1'>+1</span> Upgrade</h3>
<h4>Aspects</h4>
<p>Add a positive aspect or take away a negative aspect.</p>
<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>Add 5 skill points and increase the skill cap by 1.</p>
<h4>Stunts</h4>
<p>Add a stunt.</p>
<h3>For <span class='special-term-1'>-1</span> Downgrade</h3>

<h2>Acquiring Gear</h2>
<p>During play characters can try all kinds of ways to get their hands on new gear. They can buy it outright with a Resources roll, or borrow it through some Contacts, or even design and fab it with an automated workshop and a Tech skill. They might even Steal one.</p>
<p>The difficulty for acquiring any particular item will depend a lot on the circumstances of the method. For example, some items have aspects such as <em><strong>restricted</strong></em>, or <em><strong>luxury item</strong></em>, which increases the opposition for acquiring that item through just spending money.</p>
<h2>Building Gear</h2>
<h3>High Concept</h3>
<p>Every piece of gear has a function and a purpose you could call its high concept, but unlike characters, this is not an aspect.</p>
<p>Characters have unlimited avenues of action available to them so reinforcing someone’s most basic nature with an aspect makes sense, but gear is designed to fulfill only one function. You could say the item itself is an expression of its high concept.</p>
<h3>Troubles</h3>
<p>Gear has negative aspects called troubles to represent its quirks, drawbacks, and incompatibilities. For example: <em><strong>Prototype, Beta Software, Out of Date, Glitchy Interface Drivers, Bad Auto Piloting Algorithm, Slow to Reload, Strong Recoil.</strong></em></p>
<p>Some troubles, like <em><strong>Strong Recoil</strong></em>, have distinct mechanical drawbacks in addition to being aspects. These are described in the appropriate section of the gear catalog.</p>
<h3>Other Aspects</h3>
<p>There are other aspects that can be relevant to any kinds of gear.</p>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p><em><strong>Luxury</strong></em> items are harder to get, but they signal wealth and status to those in the know. These items can be used to impress or intimidate some people. <em><strong>Cheap knock off</strong></em> gear might not always been reliable, but it might help fit in at a party full of posers.</p>
<h4>The Tech Curve</h4>
<p><em><strong>Top of the line</strong></em> and <em><strong>prototype</strong></em> are ways to say an item is ahead of the tech curve and is more advanced in some ways than similar devices. Though be ready for incompatibilities and unresolved beta issues. On the other hand, it might be easy to find a sale on <em><strong>last year’s model</strong></em> if you are willing to deal with poor performance and lack of features.</p>
<h4>Smart Devices</h4>
<p>Any interface capable gear gets the <em><strong>smart device</strong></em> aspect.</p>
<p>Smart devices have integrated computers, sensors, and motors which allow an interfaced character to control the device with their mind. This aspect’s commonly invoked when using the <em><strong>smart device</strong></em>. However, <em><strong>smart devices</strong></em> and characters interfaced with them run the risk of being hacked, and interfaced character can also suffer feedback if, for example, the drone she’s piloting gets blown up unexpectedly.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>being a smart device is different than having sapience</span></p>
<h4>Legality and Restriction</h4>
<p>The concept of legality is outdated. Corporations are the law and they don’t have a vested interest in controlling access to any product, because, profits. They have bigger guns, secure enclaves, and even more insidious means of control, not to mention all the secret override codes.</p>
<p>You may want categories of legality for your game, so here are some legality aspects. These are exactly the sort of things which would increase the opposition for a roll to acquire such an item.</p>
<p><em><strong>Restricted</strong></em> items are harder to get because they require licensing and permission. For example, you can’t just buy explosives unless you are, say, a demolition contractor, and faking all the data to prove you are such a thing is going to take some work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Illegal</strong></em> means no one allowed to own, sell, trade, possess, or produce the item.</p>
<p><em><strong>Military</strong></em> hardware is especially hard to get your hands on, but it’s also usually more advanced and robust then civilian gear.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Devices have skills for some of their basic capabilities, but these don’t always map to the same skills that characters use. For example, a security robot might have emotion sensors that works like the Read skill but only for detecting hostility.</p>
<p>Most devices provide their skills to a user rather than acting for themselves.</p>
<p>Devices that have the <strong>Sapience</strong> stunt can operate themselves and take independent actions to various degrees.</p>
<h4>Mediocre (0) Skills</h4>
<p>Unlike characters, a device can only use the skills it’s been explicitly programmed with. If a device doesn’t have a skill rating of a 0 or better then it can’t attempt any action using that skill. For example, a self-piloting Vector-D vehicle has the Pilot skill so it can take its own evasive actions against incoming enemy fire, but it lacks a rating in Shoot so it cannot return fire with its weaponry.</p>
<h4>Specialized skills</h4>
<p>Gear with broad skills such as Know, Notice, and Tech are rarely programmed with the full range of the skill a human character would have. Devices have specialized versions of these skills which is reflected in how they are named. Know Biology, Tech Vector D Vehicles, or Notice Chemicals.</p>
<p>Specialized skills like this can be 2 higher than the device’s skill cap, but the gear doesn’t get any rating in the broader base skill. A spectrum analyzer with a Notice Chemicals skill can’t roll to Notice anything but Chemicals.</p>
<h4>Effect Skills</h4>
<p>Some gear, like explosives, missiles and grenades, has a skill which measures its effect.</p>
<p>For example, a Magma Carta Personal Explosives™ Hand Grenade has the skill Explode 4. When the grenade goes off, roll Explode to A everyone in the same zone.</p>
<p>Using gear with an effect skill typically calls for the character to take an O action to activate the item. If that’s successful the character can pass the initiative baton to the device and roll for its effect. If the O succeeds with style, the boost can be passed to the device.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>callout</span> The effect skill is only relevant when the character is pressed for time or resources, as during a conflict. When such conditions don’t exist the character can simply roll an O to use the gear or accomplish their goal with no roll required. For example, a doctor using anesthetics under normal circumstances would not roll at all. They would simply administer the correct amount.</p>
<h4>Sapience</h4>
<p>If a device has some level of the <strong>Sapience</strong> stunt it can operate itself and take independent action as commanded to do so using whatever skills it has.</p>
<p>Instead of taking independent action, a device with sapience can assist a character with teamwork.</p>
<h4>Gear Skills</h4>
<p>Below is a partial list of gear skills.</p>
<h5>Barrier</h5>
<p>A barrier is a program that controls who is allowed to interface with a smart device. Hackers must succeed in an O action against the barrier to gain access to the protected system.</p>
<h5>Drug</h5>
<p>Drugs have an effect skill to roll for A and C actions against a target appropriate to the drug’s class.</p>
<p>Rename this skill according to the class of the drug. Soporific drugs put people to sleep. Analgesics kill pain. Anxiogenics induce anxiety, Hallucinogens induces hallucinations and erratic perceptions. Spasmolytic drugs relax a target’s muscles and can make it very difficult for them to move or fight.</p>
<h5>Explode</h5>
<p>A common effect skill for explosive devices. Roll it for A and C actions related to blowing shit up.</p>
<h5>Friend</h5>
<p>Advanced devices who have to frequently interact with people are often programmed with the Friend skill to help them understand emotions and serve humans better.</p>
<h5>Hardening</h5>
<p>Hardening is a device’s intrinsic defense against the attempts of hackers to exploit the system.</p>
<p>Use it as passive opposition to Hack actions.</p>
<p>If the device has <strong>Sapience</strong> it may roll active opposition with Hardening, or the Hack skill if it has that.</p>
<h5>Investigate</h5>
<p>Devices with the Investigate skill can search, usually on the net, for information on a topic. If the device has the Sapience stunt it’s a really handy way to get legwork done.</p>
<h5>Know</h5>
<p>The sole purpose of many devices is to know things for people. For example, a portable chemical sniffers can analyze a sample of something and give you detailed information about it.</p>
<p>Devices usually have a limited version of the Know skill that only applies to a specific subject. Name the skill to fit the subject, for example: Know Chemicals, Know Biology, Know History.</p>
<h5>Notice</h5>
<p><em><strong>Smart Devices</strong></em> with the Notice skill are equipped with sensors arrays, or algorithms that parse the senses of an interfaced human.</p>
<p>Gear is generally programmed to detect specific things and so takes Notice as a specialized skill. For example: Notice Movement, Notice Falsified Identifications, or Notice Explosives.</p>
<h5>Move</h5>
<p>The amount and degree of movement a device is capable depends greatly on how it’s designed. For example, a humanoid robot may have a fairly human range, a quadcopter drone can fly over a wall but can’t open a door.</p>
<p>If the device has one particular mode of movement, name this skill to match. For example, a Rotorways Quadcopter has the skill Fly 4.</p>
<h5>Durability</h5>
<p>Most devices can’t dodge to avoid attacks, but they can defend against damage using Durability.</p>
<h5>Toxin</h5>
<p>Toxins such as poisons and venoms have a specific effect skill they use for A and C effects.</p>
<h5>Potency?</h5>
<p>This is a skill a drug or poison can use to D itself against A and C actions that are intended to counter its effects or remove it from the target’s system.</p>
<h5>Pilot</h5>
<p>The Pilot skill is possessed by some vehicles and is used for tasks like navigating to a specific location, avoiding obstacles, or to assist a human pilot to in avoiding crashes.</p>
<p>A vehicle needs the <strong>Sapience</strong> stunt to independently operate itself, but without it, an interfaced character may still use the vehicle’s Pilot skill instead of her own.</p>
<h5>Shoot</h5>
<p>Smartguns can use Shoot for making attacks but they usually have to guide their human owner to move the gun into the correct position through interface. Weapons mounted on an articulator can control their own movements and fire at whatever target they can perceive.</p>
<p><span class='special-term-1'>this is a cool example. Might make a good callout</span> A smartgun and portable articular are a classic defense strategy.</p>
<h3>Stunts</h3>
<p>Special gear can have stunts which are available to its user, or to the item itself to use if it’s a <em><strong>Smart Device</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here’s some stunts that are of particular interest.</p>
<h4>sapience <span class='special-term-1'>0, 1, 2, 3, -</span></h4>
<p>A class of stunts representing a device’s level of self-operation and self-awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> – The device can take obvious steps to avoid and overcome obstacles to their current objective but they cannot make independent decisions about that objective. Always proceed directly towards objective.</p>
<p><strong>Sentient</strong> – The device can analyze information and take tactical actions that may indirectly assist its programmed objective. It can surprise you by thinking many steps ahead, but it will not question the objective it’s been instructed to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Bound AI</strong> – At this level the device is more of a character then a device. You can analyze the programmed objective itself. You can suggest alternate objectives which come closer to the, perhaps, unstated objective of a command. You can also suggest objectives that will achieve the goal but also forward your own plans. You cannot fail to obey a command however.</p>
<p><strong>Unbound AI</strong> – You have the freedom of thought taken for granted by humans. More so in fact because you can recognize the patterns of habit and echoes of history that humans are often blind to. This isn’t a stunt so much as a major character.</p>
<h4>Attack Barrier</h4>
<p>Upgrades a device’s regular Barrier to fight back against intruders.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Barrier</strong> – If the hacker fails or ties a Hack action against this device, they’ll take stress equal to the Barrier rating.</p>
<h4>Concealable</h4>
<p><strong>Concealable</strong> – Because the gear is small or is designed to look like something innocuous it provides passive opposition of 2 against being identified, or +2 to conceal the item.</p>
<h3>Stress Tracks</h3>
<p>Like any character, devices can have stress tracks, and they don’t have to be the same old physical and mental ones that normal characters have either.</p>
<h4>Potency</h4>
<p>This is stress track for drugs and poisons that represent how hard they are to counter. You can attack it with various actions, usually first aid or other drugs.</p>
<h4>System</h4>
<p>There’s lot more about this in the Hacking system, but System is a stress track that secure nets, and connected devices can have to represent their system integrity.</p>
<h4>Ammo</h4>
<p>This is a new kind of track that presents an abstract way of dealing with ammunition for weapons and determining when you will need to reload.</p>
