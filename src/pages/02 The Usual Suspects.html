<h1 id="the-usual-suspects">The Usual Suspects</h1>
<p>This chapter is for everyone who’s going to make a character. I’ve got some archetypes for you, I’ve got your cyberpunk skills
   and edgy stunts too.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>Don’t have a solid character concept yet? Scan these six archetypical cyberpunk roles for inspiration.</p>
<aside class="left">
   <h4 id="famous-faces">Famous Faces</h4>
   <h5 id="varsha-patel">Varsha Patel</h5>
   <p>Varsha earned her role as the face of journalism for an entire generation for her unwavering and even handed coverage
      of the war between India and Pakistan and its nuclear escalation.</p>
   <h5 id="grace">Grace</h5>
   <p>Grace is an AI composer who says she began life as a corporate machine learning system designed to absorb musical data
      and decipher the patterns of popularity. In interviews she has referred to her awaking as “a singular moment of gestalt
      arising from humanity’s longing for affirmation as expressed through their music.” Grace has faced a lot of scorn,
      many music reviewers love to call her an iComposer and imply that she’s really a corporate construction designed to
      trick the listening public.</p>

      <li>list one list</li>
      <li>listy list list</li>
   </ul>
</aside>
<h3 id="face">Face</h3>
<p>Poise is power and you exploit that hard. Some think charisma is antique or that being the Face is just about lying, but
   you know the true, most people fall for the presentation not the facts and, you’re a master of presentation.</p>
<p>As the Face you may find yourself in the Dis negotiating territory rights between the Vampyre’s and the Magogs, playing a
   duet on a thought harp for millions of virtual concert goes, or change raising at a High Street Market stall.</p>
<p>The face role contains a multitude of sinners: media personalities, cult leaders, grifters, politicians, artists, rock stars,
   even your garden variety gigolo.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-a-face-different-from-a-fixer">How is a Face different from a Fixer?</h4>
<p>Charisma. The classic Face is all about personal charisma. If they make a deal, lead a team, or convince someone of something,
   it’s through their charm and affability. A fixer will offer you something you need, a Face will offer you something to
   believe in.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Friend, Read, Deceive</p>
<aside class="right">
   <h4 id="notable-deals">Notable Deals</h4>
   <h5 id="the-founding-of-the-black-talon-security-corporation">The Founding of the Black Talon Security Corporation</h5>
   <p>There didn’t used to be a Black Talon Corporation; not until its eight legendary founders, the heads of security for eight
      different corporations,</p>
   <ul>
      <li>gaming</li>
      <li>list one list</li>
      <li>listy list list</li>
   </ul>
   <p> walked off the job with their respective departments to form a new company dedicated to providing security operations
      for any corporation. How the deal went down has never been revealed, but many suspect Black Talon CEO and founder,
      Sam James III, stole sensitive secrets for blackmail leverage in his daring revolt.</p>

</aside>
<h3 id="fixer">Fixer</h3>
<p>From street corner to board room, you are the deal maker, the mastermind, the hyper connected node; you bring it all together.
   You set up the job, you hire the crew, you have the plan; you have the high level view.</p>
<p>You might lead a multinational corporation and make the biggest deals around. You might run the contracts for a crew of data
   pirates, be an independent arms smuggler, or freelance troubleshooter. But any day you may find yourself hustling in the
   High Street Market, one step ahead of your last botched job.</p>
<p>Fixers might be pimps, boardroom corp executives, arms dealers, international bankers, or masters of military organization.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-a-fixer-different-from-a-face">How is a Fixer Different from a Face?</h4>
<p>A Plan. The Face may be a powerful charismatic leader, but you have a plan, a good plan, and a track record that your crew
   can believe in.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills-2">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Contact, Resources, Friend or Troll.</p>
<h3 id="ghost">Ghost</h3>
<p>Your role is infiltration and advanced information gathering. Anyone can gather data, but you know how to transform that
   data into intelligence.</p>
<p>You know how to hound an info trail and run a humint asset. You know exactly how to break most every security system. Oh,
   and you also know an awful lot about assassination.</p>
<p>Ghosts are spies, investigators, assassins, intelligence analysts, and sometimes criminals.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-a-ghost-different-from-a-hacker-or-a-tech">How is a Ghost Different from a Hacker or a Tech?</h4>
<p>Information. Ghosts know how to interpret raw data into meaningful intelligence. A Hacker can liberate a data stream of satellite
   positioning but it takes a Ghost to tell you your data indicates ongoing covert action in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Some Ghosts have cracking and hacking skills, but they are specialized for defeating security systems, not for general programming
   or repair.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills-3">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Stealth, Notice, Investigate, Crime.</p>
<aside class="left">
   <h4 id="unsolved-hacker-crimes">Unsolved Hacker Crimes</h4>
   <p>No matter how hard the corps try to lock down the Net hackers still find ways to stay anonymous but, that means the most
      notorious hackers are the ones who get caught. Here’s a few notable hacker crimes which haven’t been convincingly claimed
      by anyone…yet.</p>
   <h5 id="the-blackout">The blackout</h5>
   <p>Ask your mom if she remembers the blackout. Back when someone didn’t just crack the Eastern Power Grid secure net, they
      crashed it. Total system failure. Massive blackouts. Chaos and destruction everywhere.</p>
</aside>
<article class="right">
   <h4 id="legends-of-the-net">Legends of the Net</h4>
   <h5 id="cp1nz">cP@1nz</h5>
   <p>Back when we used bigass cyberdecks and trodes to access a Net that was an infinite perspective grid of green lines dotted
      with gaudy neon data fortress icons, cP@1nz pulled a series of practical jokes that have yet to be topped. He’s the
      one who hacked the nuclear launch sequence to text congress “HAHA! BOOM!” instead of actually firing missiles, and
      then posted the launch codes on the Net for other hackers to exploit. Lots and lots of other hackers.</p>
   <h5 id="betty-talent">Betty Talent</h5>
   <p>Let’s be honest, most hackers get one big score before they become targets for Black Talon and every corp hacker out there.
      They don’t get to retire, they end up brain fried, but Betty Talent’s all kinds of the exception to that. After her
      big score she didn’t get dead, she got a sweet job offer to be Black Talon’s superstar hacker.</p>
   <h5 id="the-black-monk">The Black Monk</h5>
   <p>The monk is just a myth…right? A boogeyman of the Net. They say he keeps the ghosts of unfortunate hackers trapped in
      jars in some fortress in the Net, but no one can extract your consciousness through the Net, let alone keep it around
      after your meat brain dies…right?</p>

<h3 id="hacker">Hacker</h3>
<p>
   <strong>AKA</strong>: Netrunner, Console Jockey, Code Cowboy, NIMrod (
   <em>archaic</em>. From
   <strong>N</strong>eural
   <strong>I</strong>nterface
   <strong>M</strong>odem, an older generation of interface technology), Decker (
   <em>archaic</em>. From cyberdeck another obsolete interface technology).</p>
<p>In the old days you’d have programmed with keyboards and monitors but now, thanks to your interface, you soar through the
   endless virtual terrain of the Net like a vengeful god of info freedom. If they put up a wall, you tear it down with a
   thought. If they build a data prison, you code yourself a virtual grenade to blow the gates open. Thanks to your interface,
   you can do with just a thought, hacks that would have taken your granddaddy a week of coding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, your granddaddy didn’t have to worry about attack barriers and black IC that can use that magical interface
   of yours to hack your brain and mess you up in ways there aren’t even words for. Brain death is just the beginning grandson.</p>
<p>As a hacker you’ll find yourself using your skills to maybe crack Terradyne’s secure net and steal the 3d model of their
   latest VecD rotor and give it to your “employer,” or sell it to the highest bidder, or maybe both. Don’t think your “employer”
   wouldn’t do the same to you.</p>
<p>Find the Hacking section on page XXX for more about what you do.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills-4">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Hack, Investigate, Tech or Crime.</p>
<h3 id="samurai">Samurai</h3>
<p>You can’t reprogram a hostile meatbag and you can’t charm your way passed a well-armed security drone. Sometimes the solution
   to a problem is the reasoned application of extreme violence and you, my Samurai friend, excel at such applications.</p>
<p>You’ll find yourself in a dazzling variety of lethal conflicts; drawing fire or taking a beat down for whoever happens to
   be paying the bills this week. Some of the older generation say you owe a worthy foe respect because of your mutual mastery
   of death, but you know there’s more honor amongst thieves then killers like you.</p>
<p>As a Samurai you might be a bodyguard, soldier, security, gang enforcer, a pit fighter, a razor dancer, a mercenary trying
   to make a name for yourself, quick muscle for this one job, or just a straight up street thug.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills-5">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Shoot or Fight, Move, Physique</p>
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p>Life on the edge is supported by a complex tapestry of interwoven technology and specialized knowledge which goes greatly
   underappreciated by everyone, everyone but you that is. You are the expert. You are the Tech.</p>
<p>Your specialty might be medical cyberization, ancient Assyrian, or the sociology of Net based social movements, but changes
   are you know a little something about nearly everything.</p>
<p>As a Tech, you also have more the just theoretical knowledge, you have the skills to make, modify, maintain, and operate
   most devices. You can draft a new drone design, autofac it in a couple hours, and then be expertly piloting it in support
   of your team.</p>
<p>A Tech might have any number of jobs including: cyberware designer, trauma medic, hot shot pilot, mechanic, archeology, or
   back alley gene splicer.</p>
<h4 id="trademark-skills-6">Trademark Skills</h4>
<p>Bio, Tech, Pilot, Know</p>
<h2 id="your-baseline-specs">Your Baseline Specs</h2>
<p>Players, these are the starting stats for making player characters. GMs, tweaks for this baseline are discussed in the GM
   chapter on page XXX.</p>
<h3 id="aspects">Aspects</h3>
<p>Write 5 aspects for your character.</p>
<h4 id="cybernetic-body">Cybernetic Body</h4>
<!-- should maybe have a section for fate rule alterations that are supportive of cyberpunk -->
<p>If you have a cybernetic body write that into at least one aspect;
   <span class="aspect">Cyborg Mercenary</span> for example. This is important because characters without a
   <span class="aspect">cybernetic body</span> are limited to 3 for their Physique and Move skills.</p>
<article class="left">
   <p>The answers to some of these questions about your character may lead you to good aspects.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Where did they come from?</li>
      <li>Where are they headed?</li>
      <li>What’s their plan to get there?</li>
      <li>What’s their relationship to corporate power?</li>
      <li>What’s their relationship to the street?</li>
      <li>Who is your character? Can you sum them up in a single phrase like
         <span class="aspect">Broken Hacker</span>?</li>
      <li>Where, how, and why did your character get their upgrades?</li>
      <li>How much augmentation does your character have and does that affect them emotionally or mentally? Do they suffer from
         some form of Reality Disassociative Disorder?</li>
   </ul>
</article>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>Pick skills for your character according to the traditional pyramid with an apex of 4, and one additional restriction; your
   Physique and Move are limited to 3, unless you have a
   <span class="aspect">cybernetic body</span>.</p>
<h3 id="refresh-stunts">Refresh &amp; Stunts</h3>
<p>Your character gets 3 refresh and 3 stunts, with the option to cash in up to 2 refresh for more stunts.</p>
<p>You’ll spend stunt slots on most cyberware and other upgrades but not regular gear like guns and cars.</p>
<!-- is this still true? -->
<h3 id="stress-consequences">Stress &amp; Consequences</h3>
<p>Your character start with 2 physical stress boxes and 2 mental stress boxes.</p>
<p>Characters with a Physique of 4 or 5, and therefore a
   <span class="aspect">cybernetic body</span>, get an extra stress box for a total of 3 physical stress. Characters with a Physique of 6 or 7,
   get 2 extra physical stress boxes for a total of 4.</p>
<p>Characters with a Will of 4 or 5 get 1 extra mental stress box for a total of 3.</p>
<p>Characters get 1 consequence slot of each level: Mild, Moderate, and Severe.</p>
<h4 id="the-future-is-dangerous">The Future is Dangerous</h4>
<p>In the cyberpunk future even the tiniest mistake can be deadly, especially in a conflict. Confrontations are over fast, sometimes
   faster than human reflexes can keep up with. To reflect this reduced margin of safety characters get fewer then the usual
   stress boxes.</p>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p>Equipment that’s not an upgrade is just ordinary gear and you use 2 × your character’s Resources rating as a budget for picking
   starting Gear.</p>
<p>A character can also use skills to make, modify, or acquire gear during the game.</p>
<h4 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h4>
<!-- this needs to be revised. You may use stunt slots, but you do not HAVE to -->
<p>Use stunt slots to buy your character personal augmentations like a G-Gob hardened Interface implant, or a mil-grade cyberarm
   that can rip through a steel fire door.</p>
<p>Check out the Gear chapter for more possibilities.</p>
<h5 id="free-upgrades">Free Upgrades</h5>
<p>A number of upgrades are available without using stunt slots. They are listed in with a cost of 0 ¤ in the Gear section.</p>
<p>For example, you may have a basic Interface implant for no cost. You may also have a standard, meaning non-combat,
   <span
      class="aspect">Cyborg Replacement Body</span>, without using stunt slots. Such a body has both benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<h5 id="how-much-can-i-take">How Much Can I Take?</h5>
<p>Besides requiring stunt slots, there is no limit on the amount of cyberization a character can have. The toll that extensive
   body modification makes on your character is up to you to express in how you write their aspects.</p>
<h2 id="skills-2">Skills</h2>
<p>There’s only one new skill called Hack, but the names of several existing skills been dystopian futurefied.</p>
<p>The existing Fate Core skills operate as usual and so aren’t described in detail here with the exception of: Pilot, Physique
   and Resources. These skills have a complete description because their scope and importance in a cyberpunk game warrants
   it.</p>

   <p>There isn’t a skill specifically for using the Net because it’s is just new place to use your old skills, at least the
      non-physical ones. If you searching the Net for someone you’ll roll Investigate. If you are making nice in a forum,

</article>
<h3 id="gear-skills">Gear skills</h3>
<!-- incase we want to explain things about gear with skills, and gear using skills here.  -->
<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
<p>Bio is like the Tech skill, but for dealing with living stuff. Its medicine, biology, gardening, and genetic engineering.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special</strong> — To allow a physical consequence to start healing, roll Bio vs. the level of the consequence.</p>
<h4 id="bio-and-the-four-actions">Bio and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Stop your friend from bleeding out, or to design a genetically enhanced liver.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Old-fashion body hacking like entering a
   <span class="aspect">breath control trance</span>, or to use a mild stimulant concoction to
   <span class="aspect">overcharge</span> your adrenal control bioimplant.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> — Not used for attacks.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> — Not generally used for defense.</p>
<h4 id="example-stunts">Example Stunts</h4>
<p>
   <strong>Medic</strong> — You get +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> rolls when giving first aid or other emergency medical attentions.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Biofeedback</strong> — You get +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> rolls that involve controlling the natural tendencies and limitations of your meat body.</p>
<h3 id="hack">Hack</h3>
<p>Hack is the skill for computer related activities like writing programs, setting up secure nets, cracking them, or hacking
   into the tapestry smart devices to make things happen.</p>
<p>In the Net you can use Hack to get passed a security barrier and into the secure net it’s guarding. You can use Hack for
   A and D actions against hostile programs, or other hackers who are interfaced in the same system.</p>
<p>Hack requires equipment but that doesn’t have to be an interface. You can use an old fashioned keyboard and monitor, and
   it will even be safer. It will just take more time.</p>
<p>See the hacking on page XXX for more information.</p>
<h4 id="hack-and-the-four-actions">Hack and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Crack an attack barrier and get into the secure net it protects. To code an IC program to patrol your own personal
   castle in the Net, and a geisha construct to keep you company while you are there. Use it to hack your boss’s memory so
   he’ll think you’ve already completed project Daedalus.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Stir up a localized
   <span class="aspect">Packet Storm</span> that’ll keep the system you just cracked from tracing your signal. To activate the
   <span class="aspect">Fire Suppression System</span> as a distraction so your team can penetrate the Hyldyne Corporate building. Or hack the
   security controller and make yourself
   <span class="aspect">Invisible to their Security Sensors</span>.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> — Attack IC programs and other hackers if you are both interfaced in the same system.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> — Defend against most actions another hacker tries to take if you are both in the same system. Defend your own
   brain from being hacked if someone gets past the defenses on your interface.</p>
<h4 id="example-stunts-2">Example Stunts</h4>
<p>
   <strong>IC Master</strong> — You write all your own security programs. Any net security you regularly maintain provides +2 opposition
   to intrusions.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Ghost in the Net</strong> — +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> against attempts to detect, locate, track, or otherwise id your handiwork in the Net.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Code Shredder</strong> — You get +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> hostile IC and other net constructs, though not live hackers.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Deus Ex Machina</strong> — You get +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> when you are creating a physical effect.</p>
<h3 id="physique">Physique</h3>
<p>Physique has a different meaning in the dark future. You can buy yourself a brand new cybernetic body that’s stronger and
   tougher than any meat body could ever be.</p>
<p>Physique is still a measure of a character’s strength, endurance, toughness, but characters who are not cybernetically enhanced
   are limited to Physique of 3.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special</strong> — Unlike Fate Core, characters only get an extra physical stress box if their Physique is 4 or 5. A character
   gets 2 extra physical stress boxes if their Physique is 6 or 7 (Something that is possible with a very high spec cybernetic
   body).</p>
<h4 id="physique-and-the-four-actions">Physique and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Overcome obstacles that require the application of brute force—most often to overcome a situation aspect on
   a zone—or any other physical impedance, like prison bars or locked gates. Of course, Physique is the classic skill for
   arm-wrestling matches and other contests of applied strength, as well as marathons or other endurance-based challenges.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Physique has a lot of potential for advantages in physical conflict, usually related to grappling and holding
   someone in place, making them
   <span class="aspect">Pinned</span> or
   <span class="aspect">Locked Down</span>. You might also use it as a way of discovering physical impairments possessed by the target—grappling
   the old mercenary tells you that he has a
   <span class="aspect">Bum Leg</span> or some such.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> — Physique is not used to harm people directly; use the Fight skill.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> — Though you don’t generally use Physique to defend against attacks, you can use it to provide active opposition
   to someone else’s movement, provided you’re in a small enough space that you can effectively use your body to block access.
   You might also interpose something heavy and brace it to stop someone from getting through.</p>
<h4 id="example-stunts-3">Example Stunts</h4>
<p>
   <strong>Servo Enhanced Cyberarticulation</strong> — Your cyborg body is structurally enhanced and equipped with powerful load
   lifting servos. +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> rolls for carrying and lifting.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Toxin Scrubbers</strong> — Your meat organs are supplemented with bioelectrical filters and toxin scrubbers. +2 to
   <span
      class="fate-font">D</span> against drugs and poisons, including alcohol.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Grappler</strong> — +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> on foes you are grappling with.</p>
<h3 id="pilot">Pilot</h3>
<p>Pilot replaces Drive and it’s the skill for operating vehicles of all kinds; ground or air. Pilot applies if you are using
   a vehicle’s manual controls, if you are controlling it through a direct interface, or if you are operating a vehicle through
   a remote interface.</p>
<p>Many smart vehicles also have the Pilot skill and can use it to operate themselves according to human instruction, but only
   within safe operating parameters or to avoid danger.</p>
<h4 id="pilot-and-the-four-actions">Pilot and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Navigate difficult terrain or perform exceptional maneuvers.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Put yourself in prime position or to put a foe in a bad position.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> — Pilot is not normally used for attacks, unless you are ramming a target with your vehicle. In which case both
   you, your target, and your vehicle take the same amount of stress.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> — Avoid attacks and advantages that target your vehicle.</p>
<h4 id="example-stunts-4">Example Stunts</h4>
<p>
   <strong>Getaway Driver</strong> — +2 to Pilot a ground vehicle when you’re being chased.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Stunt Pilot</strong> — +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> with Pilot if you are performing an acrobatic maneuver.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Hot Pickup</strong> — +2 to
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> when you are piloting into a hostile situation for a pick up or drop off.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Enhanced Drone Control Rig</strong> — Your top of the line cyberware provides a strong and security signal for remotely
   interface piloting drones. You get +1 to pilot drones you are interfaced with.</p>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are vastly important to cyberpunk characters because in the dark future money is power, access, respect, justice,
   and freedom.</p>
<p>If someone steals your car you’ll have to take out a security contract to get it back, unless of course the thief buys off
   your contract himself and leaves you looking for alternate means of transportation.</p>
<p>Technology is constantly churning and keeping up takes money; falling behind is deadly.</p>
<p>There are places you cannot enter without a credit check, information you cannot access without an expensive subscription.</p>
<p>Resources can represent a character’s personal wealth, but it can also be a status indication showing how much of a corporations
   resources the character is trusted to have access to.</p>
<h4 id="resources-and-the-four-actions">Resources and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Acquire just about any good or service you can imagine, including a justice contract against someone who’d
   done wrong to you. Or just someone you don’t like.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Host an associate at an
   <span class="aspect">Exclusive Restaurant</span> to give you an edge in your negotiations. Hire someone to get
   <span class="aspect">Useful Dirt</span> on the Trellex board of directors.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">A</span> — Resources is not used for direct attacks.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">D</span> — Avoid many kinds of social consequences.</p>
<h4 id="example-stunts-5">Example Stunts</h4>
<p>
   <strong>Mr. Johnson</strong> — Once per scenario you can deeply tap your corporate budget to get a +2 to Resources.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Arms Dealer</strong> — Get a +2 for Resource rolls involving weapons and armor.</p>
<p>
   <strong>Emergency Stash</strong> — You have some assets safely concealed in case you lose access to your normal Resources. The
   stash represents a Resources of 2 that will last about one session. If you have an immediate need you can tap your stash
   for a +2 to Resources rolls for one session, but your stash will be gone until you spend a session without making Resources
   rolls to recharge it.</p>
<h3 id="tech-2">Tech</h3>
<p>Tech is the skill for machines and science. Mechanical, and electrical. From a simple steam engine to a complex interface
   device. Tech is also the skill for creating and using explosives.</p>
<h4 id="tech-and-the-four-actions">Tech and the Four Actions</h4>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">O</span> — Repair a broken device, design and a build a new one, or place some explosives.</p>
<p>
   <span class="fate-font">C</span> — Jury-rig a
