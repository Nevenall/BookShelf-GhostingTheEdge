    <h5 id="skillwire">Skillwire</h5>
    <p>A natural extension of sense processor and interface technologies is the skillwire implant which allows you to instantly
        plug new skills directly into your brain. They can be information sets like: languages, maps, or the personnel profiles
        of an entire company. They can be semi-active skills like piloting a specific type of vehicle, or even very active
        skills, like Kung Fu.</p>
    <p class=callout>Some people find the nearly subconscious nudging of these kind of processors unsettling, especially ones that key into
        your motor activation centers because you can find your body doing things before your conscious mind catches up;
        assuming you disable the safety protocols.</p>

        <strong>Skillwire Slot [1, 2, 3
            <span class="game-term">cr</span>]</strong> – For each Skillwire slot you can choose one program. You may change the program in a slot
        at any time, but it takes one scene for the new skill to become available to you.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Language</strong> – You can read and speak a specific language. Most tend towards the formal and correct and
            so are obviously programs; unless you are willing to pay extra for an up to date colloquialized version.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Specialty</strong> – These programs have everything you need to know about a specific topic such herbs, or military
            history. +2 to O and C actions involving that specialty.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Pilot</strong> – Contains the skills for pilot a specific type of vehicle. +2 to O for this specific model.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Kung Fu</strong> – An encyclopedic knowledge of Kung Fu moves looks very cool but unless you have a cyborg body
            or have already built up the appropriate musculature to back up the physical skills it’s not as useful as most
            teenage chipbois dream it is.
            <strong>Without cyberbody</strong> +2 for O relating to Kung Fu.
            <strong>With cyberbody</strong> Kung Fu style Fight skill set to 2. If you already have a fight skill,</p>
