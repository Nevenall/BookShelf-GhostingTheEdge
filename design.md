# Design notes for Ghosting the Edge

## Body 

A humanist sans might be a nice cyber touch. 
It might be cool to throw in a drop caps for the first parapgraph of big sections.  

### Raleway

has old style numbers, for one thing, and I believe small caps. However, the raleway italics is weird. 
Looks like there is not a stylistic alt for the italics k

I would like to be able to use the alt G glyph but I think the features are not being packaged in teh gfont packages?


I'll have to make a custom webfont to support the features that I want. 
And I can throw in a version with the stylistic alts I want, but without replacing the w.

we can create our font with unicode range merging. 

I assume if the special characters are the second font-face decl then they will 

### Cabin

cabin is way thicker then raleway. Raleway seems better for a dark background. 

### Futura 

not sure where this one came from, but I have a complete web font package. It might be good for a header actually becuase it has a lot of fun variations. There's small caps, and one with capitals that descend, which is fun. 

## Headers

Abel is ok, but has no enhancements.
