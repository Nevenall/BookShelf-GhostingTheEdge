# Design notes for Ghosting the Edge

- need to style lists and tables
- we need to specify callout-left and callout-right
- Also, right now asides are styled with headers like the rest of the text, which doesn't work well. 
  - either we should use raleway sized up for aside headers, or do the math to reduce the abel headers
- i wonder of light body font would be good for stat blocks, because then bold will have more contrast?
- can we have css automatically calculate some of the various sizes? can we use more dynamic stuff?
  - or is it better to do break point styling?
