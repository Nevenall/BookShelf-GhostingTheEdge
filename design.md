# Design notes for Ghosting the Edge

- style ordered lists
- work with, especially right aligned, sidebar/callouts to make sure list indicators are comfortably spaced from the main text.
- bump up the main text width for larger screen sizes, between 35 and 38 em? 
- callout styling
  - make a box or some horizontal rules? some kind of decoration?
  - make sure the margins are correct for all size breakpoints.
